Vaquitas are generally seen alone or in pairs, often with a calf, but have been observed in small groups of up to 10 individuals.[2]

Little is known about the life history of this species. Life expectancy is estimated at 20 years and age of sexual maturity is somewhere between 3 and 6 years of age.[14] While an initial analysis of stranded vaquitas estimated a two-year calving interval,[15] recent sightings data suggest that vaquitas can reproduce annually.[16] It is thought that vaquitas have a polygynous mating system in which males compete for females. This competition is evidenced by the presence of sexual dimorphism (females are larger than males), small group sizes, and large testes (accounting for nearly 3% of body mass).
