The smallest living species of cetacean, the vaquita can be easily distinguished from any other species in its range. It has a small body with an unusually tall triangular dorsal fin, a rounded head, and no distinguished beak. The coloration is mostly grey with a darker back and a white ventral field. Prominent black patches surround its lips and eyes.[10] Sexual dimorphism is apparent in body size, with mature females being longer than males and having larger heads and wider flippers.[7][failed verification][11] Females reach a maximum size of about 150 cm (4.9 ft), while males reach about 140 cm (4.6 ft).[12] Dorsal fin height is greater in males than in females.[7][failed verification][11] They are also known to weigh around 27 kg (60 lb) to 68 kg (150 lb). This makes them one of the smallest species in the porpoise family.
